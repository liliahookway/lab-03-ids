# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

_Should be standardized with notation as comma can be seen differentley in different countries_

## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

_Data misleading and unclear as to significance/values_




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

_Nonsensical, unreadable and unclear as to what data is showing or referring to_




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

_Unclear as to category classification or to what countries entail which groups._





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

-Wide format has more column options. Long format has more row options.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

-It's wide.

How many observations are there in the data set?

-There are five rows (excluding variables).

## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}


staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1975","1989","1993","1995","1999","2001","2003","2005","2007","2009","2011"), 
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()



```

-There are no lines on the graph.

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here




```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here



```
